# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
<br>Conditionals check if something is true or false, so it can be helpful to determine if something meets certain requirements and to give different responses depending if it's true or not.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
<br>I would like to go back and do the additional code challenges and spend that time challenging myself.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
<br>I guess the overall productive struggle, like running into an issue, reading the error message, and then understanding the error and being able to correct it.
